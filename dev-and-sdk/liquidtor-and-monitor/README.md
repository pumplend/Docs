# Liquidtor & Monitor

Pumpmax contract allows anyone to call the `liqudtion_pump`and `liqudtion_raydium` function .&#x20;

Which means everyone can call the liqudtion function and earn some profite from it .

Our liqudtion & monitor is fully open source . you can [fork it here ](https://github.com/pumplend/pumplend-liquidator)

## Why pumpmax not set permission control for liqudtion ?

We do not wants to keep the liqudtion right in our own hand . we hope we can leave this permission and right to our hole community . Also , keep the liqudtion function open , can help us avoid a lot issues when the position number rise .&#x20;

## Any benifit for the 3th part liqudtor ?&#x20;

Sure ! Every 3th part liqudtion happened,  the liqudtor will earn for `0.5%` of position size in SOL .
