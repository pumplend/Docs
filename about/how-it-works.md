# How it works ?

## Borrow

#### Step 1: Choose the Tokens to Collateralize

Users can start by selecting **pump tokens** they wish to collateralize. These tokens are secured as collateral in the lending protocol to access SOL.

#### Step 2: Borrow SOL

Once the tokens are selected and collateralized, users can borrow **SOL**. The amount of SOL that can be borrowed depends on the value of the collateralized pump tokens and the parameters set within the Pumplend protocol.

#### Step 3: Redeem Pump Tokens

Once the SOL and interest are repaid, users can redeem their **pump tokens** from the system, returning to their initial position.

### LONG

**Step 1: Choose the pump coin you want to long**

Users can use SOL for recursive lending on the target pump coin to achieve a leveraged long effect.

#### Step 2: Sell  or Repay SOL

Using the **sell** function, all coins are sold to obtain SOL. By selecting **repay**, the user pays the interest to retrieve their coins.
